A tool to create patterns using heat gun over a PET thermoplastic sheet.

Painter robot: how to paint with heat 
We started with an exploration about how we can transform the surface of a thermoplastic sheet using a heat gun. 
After several tests, we found that we can use the heat gun as a brush to ¨paint¨ the surface creating different patterns. 
The principal problem we found was the lack of control over all the process.
