A tool to create patterns using heat gun over a PET thermoplastic sheet.

Painter robot: how to paint with heat 
We started with an exploration about how we can transform the surface of a thermoplastic sheet using a heat gun. 
After several tests, we found that we can use the heat gun as a brush to ¨paint¨ the surface creating different patterns. 
The principal problem we found was the lack of control over all the process.


Design with light
Using a PET sheet 1.2 mm, we explored about qualities of the material under heat.
We were surprised for the change of color and texture and we thought about how to use this characteristics for design.
Our goal is to apply in a facade using the white part as a light sun filter and to allow views in other parts.
